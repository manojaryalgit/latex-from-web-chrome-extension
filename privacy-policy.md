# Privacy Policy for LaTeX From Web

Effective Date: June 2, 2025

## Overview

“LaTeX From Web” is a browser extension developed to help users copy LaTeX code from rendered math expressions on websites like Wikipedia, Stack Exchange, arXiv, and any platform using MathJax or KaTeX.

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This policy outlines what data is (and is not) collected and how your information is handled.

## What Information We Collect

We do **not** collect any of the following:

- **Personally Identifiable Information** (e.g., name, email, IP address)
- **Authentication Information** (e.g., passwords or tokens)
- **Health, Financial, or Communication Data**
- **Browsing History**
- **Precise Location Information**

## Local Storage

We may use the browser's local storage to save:

- Whether the extension is enabled/disabled
- The number of times LaTeX is copied (purely for local usage statistics)

This data is stored **locally** in your browser and is **not transmitted** anywhere.

## Permissions

The extension uses the following permissions:

- `activeTab`: To access and parse content on the active page.
- `clipboardWrite`: To copy LaTeX code directly to the clipboard.
- `storage`: To locally save user preferences.
- Host access (`<all_urls>`): To function across any site that renders LaTeX.

These permissions are strictly necessary to achieve the single purpose of the extension.

## No Data Sharing

We do **not** collect, sell, or share any user data with third parties.

## No Remote Code

All functionality is bundled with the extension package. We do **not** use any form of remote code (such as eval, CDN scripts, or WebAssembly from third-party sources).

## Contact

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy or the extension, please contact the developer:
